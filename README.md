These are my solutions to [codewars](http://codewars.com) [code katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)). My profile in codewars can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/Alessandro%20Perez). Languages used here are (at the moment):

* Python
* JavaScript
* C++

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

this repo includes my own solutions and just posting them helps me keep the pace, code on a daily basis, and improve as a developer. But..., **please do not use them** to cheat on the platform! In this regard, I deeply encourage you to pay attention to the following guidelines:

* Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches.
* Codewarriors should not submit my solutions as their own.
* I will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo.

Thank you!
